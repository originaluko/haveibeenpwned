HaveIBeenPwned
============================

Identify pwned accounts and passwords via the "Have I been pwned?" (https://haveibeenpwned.com) API.

This module has been updated to the HIBP v3 API which now requires authorisation in the form of an API Key.
https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#APIVersion

An API key can be obtained from https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key

# Usage Instructions

HIBP v3 API now `requires` the use of an API Key.  Make sure you are using one.
The API Key can be stored as a variable and specified with the -apiKey parameter.

Examples:

Get-PwnedAccount -EmailAdddress email@domain.com -apiKey "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"\
Returns all accounts that have been pwned via the supplied email address / username.

Get-PwnedAccount -csv c:\temp\emailaddress.csv -apiKey "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"\
Imports a list of email addresses in csv format.  Each email address being a seperate row.

Get-PwnedPassword -Password monkey\
Identifies if the password has been found. *No API key required

Get-PwnedPassword -Password monkey -Padding false\
Identifies if the password has been found with response padding removed. *No API key required

$Password = Read-host -AsSecureString\
Get-PwnedPassword -SecureString $Password
Identifies if the password, in the SecureString variable $Password, has been found

Get-PwnedPassword -SHA1 AB87D24BDC7452E55738DEB5F868E1F16DEA5ACE\
Identifies if the SHA1 hash of the password has been found. *No API key required

Further examples for each function can be found by typing\
Get-Help {function name} -Examples

# Future

Testing with an API Key!

# Issues

The HIBP API now requires the use of a UserAgent.  Old versions didn't specify this by default.
Always make sure you're running the latest version.  

If using the CSV import functionality of Get-PwnedAccount.  The default 1500 millisecond delay
between checking pwned accounts may not be large enough and cause rate-limiting.  Increasing
the rate limit can be achieved with parameter "RateLimit" and increasing the value above 1500.
